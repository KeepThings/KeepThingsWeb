## 1. Introduction

### 1.1	Purpose
The purpose of this document is to describe the functionality of the Web-Application and Mobile-Application our team is creating. Both simplify the lending of things to other people by making an entry, that stores all information about it, with just a few clicks.

### 1.2	Scope
The project consists of three main parts. The Web-Application, the Mobile-Application and the API.

The API serves as an interface between the Web-Application/Mobile-Application and the database.

The Web-Application contains a dashboard that shows all things the user lent to others with their respective information. It is also possible to lend new things to others. 

The Mobile-Application has all the features of the Web-Application. Furthermore, in the Mobile-Application the user is able to send a message to the person he lent something.

## 2. Overall Description
The idea of KeepThings is to lend things as fast and easy as possible to other people. The user will be able to do this with just a few clicks. He will also be able to keep track of all things he lent.

The API can push entries from the applications into an Online-Database and information from the database to the applications. The entries contain all information about the thing that is going to be lend. It can also push a Contact-List from the Mobile-Application into the database, so the Web-Application has access to it.

The Web-Application/Mobile-Application is going to be accessed with a User-Account. It contains the name, email of the user and a password. This account is stored in the database. After the login or registration, the user is able to make new entries to lend things to other people. A dashboard shows the user all information about the things he lent to others. Furthermore, in the Mobile-Application the user is able to import his local Contact-List into the database and send reminders to persons he lent something.
